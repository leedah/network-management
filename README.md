# Full-stack development of a web application for visualisation and analysis of geographic and battery data of users obtained through their mobile phone

Developed in the context of the Network Management course at University of Athens in the spring of 2015 together with Sophia Kypraiou.

## Technologies and frameworks

 Web Application implemented in Java using JavaServer Pages (JSP) and Servlets. For the Front-End we used the Bootstrap library as well as the ShieldUI library for the diagrams.

On the server side, we used Hibernate in order to store and manipulate more easily the datasets, since it offers a mapping between the Java classes and the SQL databases.

On the client side, we used JavaServer Pages to create dynamic web pages, alongside Javascript and jQuery as well as the the Google Map's API.

The communication between server and client was done with Java servlets using POST and GET. To call multiple servlets we used AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML).
We also used JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and GeoJSON.

## Purpose 

 The application analyses geolocated data, such as access points and base stations that users connected to, 
 and evaluates stay points and points of interest using DBSCAN algorithm.
